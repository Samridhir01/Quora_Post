# Restful API Sample Code

Welcome to the Restful API sample code repository. This repository contains files that demonstrate the concept of Restful APIs.

## Contents

- **Sample Code:** Included are files that illustrate the implementation of a Restful API.
- **Useful Files:** Essential resources to help understand and implement Restful API concepts.

## Getting Started

To run the sample code, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node Modules:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, acquire the required Node modules by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command will install all necessary dependencies.
2. **Run the Application:** Once dependencies are installed, you can run the application using:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the application and make it accessible locally.

## About

This project was completed with the assistance of Delta-Batch. Through this collaboration, I gained valuable insights into Restful API development and best practices.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own projects!
